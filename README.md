# Programming document for numerical methods

This project is a reading notes, about how to code for different numerical methods. 

This is mainly to exercise my English writing ability. 
Many documents are just a preliminary draft, and I hope I can keep improving them.

# Numerical methods

Since there are many interesting algorithms, I decided to start with the few methods I know.

- Finite Difference Method (FDM)

- Finite Element Method (FEM)

- Multiscale Finite Element Method (MsFEM)

- Generalized Multiscale Finite Element Method (GMsFEM)

- Constraint energy minimizing - GMsFEM (CEM-GMsFEM)

# Coding

About the coding language, I will use Python or C++ to the coding, but mainly use Python.

## Python 

Here are some fundamental package for scientific computing in Python.

- Numpy
- Scipy
- Multiprocessing
- Fealpy

Maybe you will be unfamiliar to Fealpy, it's a finite element analysis library in Python, developed by Prof. Wei Huayi in Xiangtan University.

## C++
