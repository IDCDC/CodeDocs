# Programming document for numerical methods



​	In this project, I will talk about how to coding some numerical methods, but mainly talk about the MsFEMs.

​	About the coding language, I mainly used Python. The mainly results and some notations is based on the Python library developed by Professor Wei Huayi of Xiangtan University.
